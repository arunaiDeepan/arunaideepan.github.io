### Description

- Maintained complete ownership of AWS cloud resources using Terraform, ensuring scalable and consistent infrastructure management across environments.
- Designed and implemented robust CI/CD pipelines for building, testing, and deploying applications across multi-cloud environments, including Amazon EKS and OpenShift clusters on IBM Cloud.
- Developed end-to-end pipelines that build Docker images, generate Helm charts, and execute multi-stage testing across various QAT environments in EKS.
- Implemented and managed GitLab CI/CD pipelines to automate the build, test, and deployment processes for multiple projects.
- Utilized Terraform to provision and manage AWS infrastructure, ensuring scalability, reliability, and cost-effectiveness.
- Integrated Terraform scripts into GitLab pipelines, automating the deployment and configuration of infrastructure as part of the continuous integration process.
- Collaborated with the team to define CI/CD best practices, including the use of Infrastructure as Code (IaC) via Terraform, to enhance reproducibility and consistency in the SDLC.
- Configured and maintained GitLab Runners for efficient parallelized builds, optimizing pipeline performance.
- Worked closely with other developers to troubleshoot build failures, resolve integration issues, and enhance overall pipeline reliability.
- Took responsibility for security across cloud environments and code dependencies by implementing automated monitoring, incident response pipelines, and AWS Lambda functions.
- Integrated security scanning tools into CI/CD pipelines to ensure code quality and identify vulnerabilities early in the development process.
- Created and maintained documentation for CI/CD processes and Terraform configurations, enabling effective knowledge transfer and smoother onboarding.
- Developed a Python-based AWS Lambda function and deployed it using Terraform and GitLab pipelines, contributing to deployment automation and operational efficiency.
- Coordinated directly with clients to streamline and support smoother deployments on their infrastructure.
- Created lightweight CLI tools in Go for both local development and GitLab pipelines, enhancing developer productivity and standardizing routine tasks.
