[{"content":"Description Implemented and managed GitLab CI/CD pipelines to automate the build, test, and deployment processes for multiple projects. Utilized Terraform to provision and manage AWS infrastructure, ensuring scalability, reliability, and cost-effectiveness. Integrated Terraform scripts into GitLab CI/CD pipelines, automating the deployment and configuration of infrastructure as part of the continuous integration process. Collaborated with team to define CI/CD best practices, including the use of Terraform for infrastructure as code (IaC) to enhance reproducibility, consistency and ensure seamless integration into the software development lifecycle. Configured and maintained GitLab Runners for efficient parallelized builds, optimizing pipeline performance. Worked closely with other developers to troubleshoot build failures, resolve integration issues, and enhance overall pipeline reliability. Integrated security scanning tools into CI/CD pipelines to ensure code quality and identify vulnerabilities early in the development process. Created and maintained documentation for CI/CD processes and Terraform configurations, enabling knowledge transfer and onboarding of new team members. Developed a Python-based AWS Lambda function and deployed it using Terraform and GitLab pipelines, contributing to the automation and efficiency of the deployment process.
